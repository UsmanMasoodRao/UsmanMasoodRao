# About Me
I am a researcher in Control Co-Design and Optimization of Wave Energy Converters (WECs). My work focuses on integrating control strategies with system design to enhance the performance, efficiency, and reliability of wave energy conversion systems.

# Research Interests
Control Co-Design (CCD) – Simultaneously optimizing control and physical design for improved energy capture and structural resilience.
Wave Energy Converters (WECs) – Developing efficient and cost-effective wave energy technologies.
Optimization Techniques – Applying numerical and computational methods to optimize WEC performance.
System Dynamics and Modeling – Simulating and analyzing wave-structure interactions for robust design.
# Goals & Objectives
Improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of WECs through CCD methodologies.
Develop innovative control strategies for enhanced energy extraction.
Contribute to the advancement of sustainable marine renewable energy.
Feel free to connect with me for discussions, collaborations, or inquiries related to wave energy and control co-design!
